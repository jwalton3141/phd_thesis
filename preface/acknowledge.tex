    This thesis wouldn't have been possible without the saintly patience of my
    supervisors Andrew Baggaley, Andrew Fletcher and Colin Gillespie, who were
    tasked with the unenviable job of keeping me on-topic. Thank you for your
    guidance, expertise, and endless creative flair in getting me out of
    faculty workshops and the dreaded ``MAGIC'' lecture series.

    Within the department I'd like to thank my friends and office-mates for
    their unwavering companionship and \emph{insatiable} desire for distraction
    and procrastination. I must also express my gratitude to Michael Beaty and
    George Stagg for helping with my (sometimes sensible) computing requests.

    Of course it is only with the financial support of EPSRC that my last few
    years of study have been viable. So, EPSRC, if you're reading this: thank
    you.

    Lastly, dear reader, thank you for your keen eye for typographical detail,
    and for looking at the pictures, but not reading the text too closely\ldots
