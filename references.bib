This is an example of a BibTeX references file.  Any reference you'll ever need
can go in this one file.  In your thesis/paper you just need to say

\bibliography{references}	%References
\bibliographystyle{style_file}	%BibTeX (.bst) style file

which will automatically include any references you mention in your thesis.
Any references you don't make are not included.  If you want to include a
reference you don't mention just use

\nocite{label}

which will insert the reference 'label' into your bibliography.  I like the
style file (jfm.bst) provided by the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.  You can
download it from their website (http://jfm-www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/).
