\chapter{Case Study II: Foraging Scoters}
\label{cha:scoters}

In the previous chapter we discussed how data could easily go missing during
flocking events. In \emph{this} chapter we shall consider a dataset which
details a real flocking event with missing observations. As foreshadowed in the
previous chapter, the missing observations of this dataset are a consequence of
employing fixed-location recording equipment.

The dataset considered in this chapter describes the movements of a large
number of surf scoters, a migratory sea bird, which gather in groups to forage.
The captured flocking events take place on the surface of a lake, and so
movement is effectively restricted to a two-dimensional plane. This dataset was
provided courtesy of work performed by \textcite{lukeman09,lukeman10}. At the
time the captured events represented a tenfold increase in the number of
individuals which could be reliably tracked between frames.

Unfortunately, owing to the fixed location cameras used to record these
flocking events, there were often scoters out of view during recorded frames.
This can be seen by considering \cref{fig:lukeman_extraction}, which shows
frames captured during the recording process. As in \cref{cha:missing}, the
missing data points can be partitioned into observations missing at the
\emph{beginning} of the recording event, and observations missing at the
\emph{end} of the recording event.

In this chapter we shall fit a simple variation of the Vicsek model to a
flocking event of this dataset. The missing data points will be integrated out
of the problem, using the methodology developed in \cref{cha:missing}.

\section{Scoter data}

\textcite{lukeman10} captured their flocking events from an aerial vantage
point: an elevated promenade at the side of a large lake. From this position
the authors were able to direct a camera toward an inlet where overwintering
scoters had been observed foraging. Knowing the height of this camera above the
water, and the angle of its approach with the horizontal, the authors were able
to transform the captured camera data back to `real-world' co-ordinates.

However, to reliably transform back from the camera co-ordinates to real-world
co-ordinates, the height of the camera above the lake and its angle with the
horizontal had to be fixed. With the camera fixed in position, the authors then
waited for flocking events to occur. Recording began when individuals entered
the camera's field of vision, and ceased when all the individuals left the
frame, or the flock became stationary.

Each recording event captured the movements of $\approx170$ scoters, with each
event lasting for $\approx30$ frames. However, for these sequences between
$16\%$ and $64\%$ ($\approx800$--$3000$ observations)
of the data points were missing.

\textcite{lukeman10} discounted the influence of individuals out-of-frame, and
instead focussed on reproducing radial and nearest neighbour distributions of
\emph{internal} group members. This approach, although representing a
\emph{significant} step forward in the literature, came with its drawbacks.
Most significantly, focussing the fitting on reproducing nearest-neighbour and
radial neighbour distributions removed the \emph{dynamic} component to the data
which the authors worked so hard to extract.

Here we take a more holistic approach to model fitting; making sure to account
for \emph{all} individuals---both observed and missing, as well as internal and
boundary individuals---and focussing the fitting on reproducing the
\emph{movements} of the individuals, rather than some \emph{epiphenomena} of
the movements. With the additional demand of inferring posterior distributions
of parameters, rather than simple point estimates, as well as handling the
missing data, this approach will represent a more computationally demanding
problem than that faced originally.

\section{Inference}

In \cref{cha:missing} we discussed how the computational load of our inference
scheme increases as the number of missing observations increases. With this in
mind we will be focussing on an event within the Lukeman dataset which displays
the \emph{least} amount of missingness. For the events captured by
\textcite{lukeman10} this is represented by a sequence of $199$ scoters moving
over $23$ frames. Of the $199\times23=4577$ data points represented by this
event, $680$ ($\approx16\%)$ of the datapoints occur out of the visual field of
the camera. This particular event is visualised in \cref{fig:scoter_traj}.

\begin{figure}[tb]
  \includegraphics{data_00_traj.pdf}
  \caption{A visualisation of the trajectories of foraging scoters in the
    analysed sequence. The scoters move along the blue trajectories, starting
    from the positions denoted by the green markers and finishing at the
    positions shown by the red markers. The black frame containing the
    trajectories represents the fixed field of vision of the recording
    equipment.}
  \label{fig:scoter_traj}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:scoter_missing} gives a visual representation of which data points
were observed, and which data points were missing. In this visualisation blue
markers represent observed data and red markers represent missing data. From
\cref{fig:scoter_missing} we see that in \emph{every frame} there is \emph{at
least one} missing agent. As such, if we were to discard all the frames with
missing scoters (the naive approach, as discussed in \cref{cha:missing}), we
would actually end up discarding the entire dataset.

The simulated flocks considered in \cref{cha:missing} had between $10$ and $20$
missing observations per sequence. With $680$ data points missing from the
scoter sequence with the \emph{least} amount of missingness, this problem
represents a considerable increase in complexity. With this amount of
missingness, long and expensive simulations will be necessary to realise a
satisfactory number of samples from the posterior.

\begin{figure}[tb]

  foraging event shown in \cref{fig:scoter_traj}. The $x$-axis represents the
  frame of the sequence, and the $y$-axis corresponds to tracked individuals. A
  blue tile at location $(i,t)$ tells us that scoter $i$ was observed in frame
  $t$. A red tile at $(i,t)$ indicates that scoter $i$ was missing at time $t$.}

\end{figure}

We will fit a variation of the Vicsek model to this dataset, where each agent
interacts with neighbours within distance $r$, and experiences noise generated
from a generalised Student's $t$ distribution with $\nu$ degrees of freedom and
scale $\sigma_Y$. A random walk Metropolis--Hastings algorithm was implemented
to infer the parameters of the model. In a similar manner, a random walk
Metropolis--Hastings algorithm, with proposal scheme as outlined in
\cref{ssec:beg_missing}, was used to infer the observations missing at the
beginning of the sequence. Finally, using a Gibbs step within the
Metropolis--Hastings step allowed observations missing at the end of the
sequence to be sampled. This sampler was implemented for $10^7$ iterations.
To reduce the memory overhead of this sampler, the recorded samplers were
thinned by a factor of $1000$. This means that all but every $1000$-th
iteration of the sampler was discarded.

In \cref{cha:missing} we used summary plots---such as those in
\cref{fig:beg_summary,fig:end_summary}---to help visualise high-dimensional
posterior distributions. However, with $680$ dimensions (plus a few extra for
the model parameters), this posterior has too many dimensions for even these
summary plots. In such a situation it can be informative to graphically assess
the trace of the log-likelihood. If we can observe that the log-likelihood has
converged, we have good evidence that all the changes also converged.

\begin{figure}[tb]
  \includegraphics{log_likelihood.pdf}
  \caption{Trace and histogram plots of the log-likelihood, as computed at
    every iteration of the inference scheme. As it can be difficult to assess
    the convergence of all the parameters for high-dimensional problems, as we have
    here, it can instead be informative to assess the convergence of the
    log-likelihood. If we see that the value of the log-likelihood has
    converged, then we have evidence that the corresponding parameters also
    converged.}
