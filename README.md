# Building

This project comes with a `Makefile` so building should be easy.

I used the luxurious [MinionPro font](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/minion) for
submission.

To build with MinionPro you must first run `./scripts/make_minion.sh`. The
script does *not* require root privileges, but it does require an install of
[LCDF typetools](http://www.lcdf.org/type/) and a complete TeXLive or MiKTeX
install. This script need only be run once.
