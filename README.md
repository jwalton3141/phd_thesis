## Style

I took much inspiration from [Dave Robertson's thesis template](https://mas-gitlab.ncl.ac.uk/b0036119/thesis-template).

## Font

Text is typeset in Adobe's MinionPro (which can be [downloaded here](https://www.wfonts.com/font/minion-pro)). Symbols are provided by MnSymbol. The project [FontPro](https://github.com/sebschub/FontPro) can be used to install MinionPro for use with pdflatex.

## Make

I have been using [latexmk](http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/support/latexmk/latexmk.pdf) for compilation. latexmk determines the number of runs necessary for a complete compile.
